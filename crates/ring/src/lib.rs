#![deny(unsafe_code)]
//! The one place the runner waits.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! - [`Ring`] is a resource over one io_uring. A module submits a typed
//!   op, [`Ring::recvmsg`] or [`Ring::sendmsg`], and gets a [`Token`].
//!   The ring owns the op's buffers until [`Ring::finish`] gives them
//!   back as a [`Completed`]; the submitter keeps the fd open until then.
//! - Every completion is one [`IoEvent`] signal. The module that owns
//!   the token finishes it; every other module ignores it.
//! - [`Ring::turn`] is one pass: [`BeforeWait`] (the last chance to
//!   submit), block for at least one completion, one `IoEvent` each,
//!   flush. The runner [`RingModule`] sets is tick, turn, repeat, until
//!   a [`Stop`] signal.
//! - A turn with no op in flight blocks forever: the Wayland read is
//!   always armed, so an app with `WaylandModule` never waits on
//!   nothing.
//!
//! This is the one crate in the workspace that allows unsafe code, in
//! `op.rs` alone: the `msghdr`s the kernel reads and the submission push.
//!
