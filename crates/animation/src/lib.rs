#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Duration- or speed-based transitions from Taffy's [`ComputedLayout`] to displayed [`Layout`].
//!
//! Install after `LayoutModule` and `WindowModule`, and before `RenderModule`.
//! This module maintains all displayed layouts: nonanimated nodes copy their
//! targets, while animated nodes interpolate.
//! Layout and paint settings inherit independently from the nearest configured
//! ancestor; a zero duration overrides inheritance and snaps that property.
//! Layout roots always snap. The first layout resolution is copied immediately
//! by the animation module. Later resolutions, including a compositor resize
//! during startup, can start transitions.
//!
//! After each layout pass, changed targets start transitions and active windows
//! request frames. On `Frame`, the clock is sampled and displayed geometry is
//! advanced before rendering. A replacement target restarts from the currently
//! displayed layout, without velocity matching. Hit testing still uses targets.
//!
//! # Scheduling
//!
//! There are two separate jobs, not two ways to advance an animation:
//!
//! - [`LayoutDone`](layout::LayoutDone) means the tick's layout pass has finished. Its system
//!   reconciles targets and settings with existing transitions, copies nodes
//!   that should not animate, and requests frames for windows needing work.
//!   The signal is sent even when no root needed recomputing, so disabling
//!   animation and continuing existing transitions do not require a new layout.
//! - [`Frame`] names one window with a drawing opportunity. Its system samples
//!   existing transitions into `Layout` before the renderer reads it. This is
//!   not a notification that pixels have reached the display.
//!
//! The normal order, with the modules installed as described above, is:
//!
//! ```text
//! PostTick:   layout resolves targets and queues LayoutDone; Time is sampled
//! LayoutDone: copy nonanimated targets, prepare transitions, notify, request frames
//! Frame(w):   sample Time, advance w's transitions, then render w
//! ```
//!
//! These are queued signals, not a fixed-rate clock or necessarily adjacent
//! operations. The platform decides when requested frames can run. [`Time`]
//! only samples the clock; it does not install a timer or wake the runner.

TODO:

Maybe this trait can be removed. We only use it for the settings() function

Either way, both are self.0. It is useful to distinguish a settings type, if
only it was used globally and had a global meaning

Perhaps we can make this kind of like a "private component, don't touch" trait.
We can then mark the Transition structs as SettingsComponent(s).
