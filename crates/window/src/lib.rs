#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! The window module: the [`Window`] widget, which window a node belongs
//! to, the list of live windows, and the frame request loop between the
//! app and whatever presents a window.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! - A window is a node built from [`window()`], a child of the app root
//!   and a layout root: its `LayoutStyle` is the box it asks for and its
//!   `Layout` is laid out from the origin in its own coordinates. The
//!   default style is a column sized to its content.
//! - [`InWindow`] is on every node: the window it belongs to, a window's
//!   being itself, `None` outside every window. Written once, at spawn.
//! - [`Windows`] is the live list, in spawn order, exact after every
//!   flush; any tick that changed it fires `OnChanged<Windows>` once.
//! - The loop: anyone signals [`RequestFrame`] as often as it likes.
//!   This module forwards the first as one [`FrameRequested`] to the WSI
//!   (whatever presents the window) and swallows the rest. The WSI signals
//!   [`Frame`] when its callback fires; the drawer draws inside it, and
//!   the module clears its pending bit so the next request opens a new
//!   cycle. A request raised by a `Frame` system runs after it and opens
//!   the next cycle by itself.
//! - The WSI reports facts as events at the window node: [`Resized`]
//!   rewrites the style's size, [`ScaleFactorChanged`] is stored on the
//!   widget and asks for a frame, [`CloseRequested`] is left to whoever
//!   spawned the window.
//!
//! Nothing here knows a compositor, a role, a paint or a renderer. Who
//! raises `RequestFrame` is the seam: layout, paint and animation each
//! have their reasons and none is this module's.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```

//!         .title("hello")
//!         .layout(LayoutStyle::default().column().size(px(320.0), px(200.0))),
//! );
//! app.tick();
//! assert_eq!(
//!     app.component::<Layout>(win).unwrap().rect,
//!     Rect::new(0.0, 0.0, 320.0, 200.0)
//! );
