#![deny(unsafe_code)]
//! The GLES 3.0 backend: one device, the atlas resident on it, dmabuf
//! render targets, and the draw of a `render::Queue`.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! - [`Device::open`] takes the first render node, a GBM device, an EGL
//!   display over it and a GLES 3.0 context, current on the calling
//!   thread for the device's life. No GPU, or no 3.0, is a panic.
//! - The atlas lives in two array textures allocated once from a
//!   [`Budget`] and never rebound: glyph and icon pages as layers of an
//!   `R8` array on unit 0, image pages as layers of an `RGBA8` array on
//!   unit 1, five levels each. A page table maps an `AtlasId` to its
//!   class and layer in a uniform. [`Device::upload`] gives new pages a
//!   layer and sends dirty cells as row runs straight from page memory;
//!   most frames upload nothing.
//! - A [`Target`] is a dmabuf: a GBM buffer laid out by the first of the
//!   compositor's modifiers the GPU accepts, linear otherwise, wrapped as
//!   an EGLImage into a colour renderbuffer with a 16-bit depth
//!   renderbuffer and one FBO. Its planes go to `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1`.
//! - [`Device::draw`] uploads both passes' commands as the bytes they
//!   are, clears each damage rect, then draws the opaque pass with depth
//!   write and no blending and the translucent pass with depth test and
//!   premultiplied blending: one instanced draw of the whole pass per
//!   damage rect. No texture is bound inside a frame.
//! - Everything is device pixels, y included: GL row 0 is the buffer's
//!   first row, which is the row the compositor reads as the top, so
//!   nothing is flipped anywhere — not in the vertex shader, not in the
//!   scissor, not in the readback. `z` maps to depth so higher is nearer.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use geometry::{Color, Rect, Size};
//! use gles::prelude::*;
//! use render::{Pass, Queue};
//!
//! let mut device = Device::open(Budget::default());
//! let target = device.target(320, 200, &[]);
//! let queue = Queue {
//!     size: Size::new(320.0, 200.0),
//!     scale: 1.0,
//!     clear: Color::rgb(0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
//!     depth: 2.0,
//!     scissor: vec![Rect::new(0.0, 0.0, 320.0, 200.0)],
//!     opaque: Pass::default(),
//!     translucent: Pass::default(),
//! };
//! device.draw(&target, &queue);
//! let rgba = device.read(&target);
//! assert_eq!(&rgba[..3], &[26, 51, 77]);
