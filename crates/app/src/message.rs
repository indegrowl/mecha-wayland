//! The two kinds of message in the runtime, and the built-in ones.
//!
//! - A [`Signal`] is app-wide: it goes to every *system* registered for
//!   its type, through [`App::signal`](crate::App::signal).
//! - An [`Event`] is node-level: it goes to the *handlers* of the nodes it
//!   is emitted at, through [`App::emit`](crate::App::emit).
//!
//! Both are markers. Any `'static` type can be one, or both. Nothing runs
//! when a message is sent; [`App::flush`](crate::App::flush) runs it.
