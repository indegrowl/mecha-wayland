#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! The render module: a window's `Layout` and `Paint` joined into a
//! command queue a GPU backend executes without a decision.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! - On `Frame(w)` the window's subtree is walked in preorder and every
//!   visible paint becomes one or more [`Command`]s in device pixels, the
//!   window's scale applied. Each node takes a z of twice its preorder
//!   index; higher is nearer.
//! - The walk carries a *solid* down: the colour and rect known to be
//!   exactly that colour behind a node, starting from the window's clear
//!   colour. A primitive inside a solid goes to the opaque pass whole,
//!   its `background` set, so the shader composites its edges, border or
//!   tile onto it and writes depth. An opaque, edge-free quad with an
//!   opaque colour is a plain fill and goes to the opaque pass wherever
//!   it is. Anything else with nothing known behind it blends in the
//!   translucent pass; an opaque-coloured quad with edges also writes its
//!   flat interior as an opaque fill at `z + 1`. Each primitive's
//!   `is_opaque` in `paint` opts out of the opaque pass. The solid is what
//!   the parent painted; an earlier sibling that blended over it is not
//!   known, so a later sibling inside the solid composites onto the
//!   parent's colour and its depth write covers the earlier one where
//!   their rects overlap.
//! - `Layout` and `Paint` changes, and removals, mark the nodes and raise
//!   `RequestFrame` for their window; nothing else does, and nothing runs
//!   on `Tick`. The walk damages a marked node's old and new bounds, a
//!   removed node's last bounds, and the whole window on the first frame
//!   or a new size or scale. A write that lands between the drain and a
//!   `Frame` is drawn by that frame and, when it moved or resized the
//!   node, damaged by it too; only a same-bounds change, a colour, is
//!   damaged one frame late.
//! - [`Scenes`] keeps the last few frames' damage per window, as many as
//!   [`RenderModule::buffers`] says. A backend asks [`Scenes::queue`] for
//!   the buffer it will draw into by its age and gets a [`Queue`]: the
//!   scissor to clear, and per [`Pass`] the rects it has something to
//!   draw in and the commands that touch them, already sorted.
//! - [`Command`] is `repr(C)` and uploaded as is. Tiles pass through from
//!   `paint`; uploading atlas pixels is the backend's business against the
//!   atlas, not this module's.
//!
//! Installs after `LayoutModule`, `PaintModule` and `WindowModule`; a
//! backend installs after this.
