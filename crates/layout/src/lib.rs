#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! The layout module: `LayoutStyle` and `Measure` in, `Layout` out,
//! through taffy's flexbox and block algorithms over the core's columns.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! - Every node carries a [`LayoutStyle`], the box it asks for, and a
//!   [`Measure`], how a leaf sizes itself under the constraints it is
//!   offered. Both are written by whoever owns the node.
//! - A node marked with [`LayoutRoot`]`(true)` is the top of one tree to
//!   lay out. Its subtree is laid out in its coordinates, the root's box
//!   at the origin, sized by the root's own style. A node under no root is
//!   never laid out.
//! - Every node carries a [`Layout`], the resolved box in whole pixels,
//!   written by the pass only when it changed, so `OnChanged<Layout>`
//!   names exactly the boxes that moved.
//! - The pass runs on `PostTick`, ahead of the core's `OnChanged` drains,
//!   and takes the change records for the three inputs itself, so
//!   `OnChanged<LayoutStyle>`, `OnChanged<Measure>` and
//!   `OnChanged<LayoutRoot>` never fire while [`LayoutModule`] is
//!   installed. A spawn or removal dirties the parent's root. Only dirty
//!   roots are recomputed; taffy's cache skips unchanged subtrees.
//! - [`LayoutDone`] is signalled once per tick, after the pass, naming
//!   the roots recomputed; empty when none was.
//!
//! # When a change is seen
//!
//! Everything written between ticks, and everything written by a `Tick`
//! system or a handler `Tick` caused, is laid out in the next `PostTick`.
//! A spawn or removal queued by a `Tick` system, or a write by a system
//! on a signal `Tick` queued, arrives after `PostTick` and is laid out the
//! tick after. Nothing is lost.
